Title: ADR-0001

Subject:
	To be able to turn slices, we have to change cells' color, which are
	private in the Face class

Possible workarounds:
	1) We could use setters
		Pros:
			- most common way to update states
		Cons:
			- breaks encapsulation
			- boilerplate code
			- poor OOP design (makes Face plain data, instead of behavior)
	2) We could make Face an inner-class of Cube, so the Cube can access
		individual cells
		Pros:
			- encapsulation
		Cons:
			- the Cube.c file would get bigger

Chosen solution:
	We chose to make Face an inner-class of Cube
